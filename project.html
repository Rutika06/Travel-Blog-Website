        <pre>Maharashtra tourism holds immense growth potential, thanks to its robust infrastructure and diverse attractions. While the state boasts a rich
             historical and cultural heritage, these facets have been underexplored by both the tourism industry and government agencies. With existing 
             infrastructure and private investments, tourism could generate numerous job opportunities. However, the lack of comprehensive planning and 
             coordination among various government departments has hindered progress. The Maharashtra government, through DCEL, has outlined a 20-year sustainable 
             tourism development plan that prioritizes private sector involvement, environmental considerations, and socio-economic factors, fostering an
             integrated approach among concerned departments.</pre>
